# LearnVanishingIdeal
 
This `Julia` package aims at learning an algebraic variety from a list of points. It runs under the assumption that the underlying variety is a complete intersection. At the moment, either a maximum occuring degree among the generators of the vanishing ideal or a list of degrees is required as input. In addition, we assume that the codimension of the variety is known.
